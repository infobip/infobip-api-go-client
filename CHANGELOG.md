## [[3.0.0](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-api-go-client/releases/tag/3.0.0)] - 2024-10-24

üéâ **NEW Major Version of `infobip-api-go-client`.**

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE: This release contains breaking changes! From this point onward `Go` 1.13 is no longer supported. The minimum supported version is `Go` 1.18.

### Changed
* To improve maintainability and organization, we have separated the models for each Infobip product into their own directories. This means that each product ‚Äîsuch as `SMS`, `Messages API`, or other services‚Äî will now have its own dedicated folder for models, making it easier to manage dependencies and clearly see which models are tied to each specific product. Users will now find a more structured, modular design, allowing easier integration and upgrades in the future.
