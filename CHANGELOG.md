All notable changes to the library will be documented in this file.

The format of the file is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this library adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) as mentioned in [README.md][readme] file.

## [[3.0.0](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-api-go-client/releases/tag/3.0.0)] - 2024-10-24

ðŸŽ‰ **NEW Major Version of `infobip-api-go-client`.**

âš  IMPORTANT NOTE: This release contains breaking changes! From this point onward `Go` 1.13 is no longer supported. The minimum supported version is `Go` 1.18.

In this release, we updated and modernized the infobip library. It is auto-generated and different from the previous version.

### Added
* Most recent [Infobip SMS API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/channels/sms) feature set.
* Support for [Infobip Messages API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/platform/messages-api).
* Added mock tests to verify the correctness of request payloads and response handling.

### Changed
* To improve maintainability and organization, we have separated the models for each Infobip product into their own directories. This means that each product â€”such as `SMS`, `Messages API`, or other servicesâ€” will now have its own dedicated folder for models, making it easier to manage dependencies and clearly see which models are tied to each specific product. Users will now find a more structured, modular design, allowing easier integration and upgrades in the future.
