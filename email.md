# Email API example

This example demonstrates how to use the [Infobip Email API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/channels/email). You'll learn how to initialize an email client,
send a message, and receive a delivery report.

The first step is to add your configuration, initialize the api client and set your authentication:

````go
    configuration := infobip.NewConfiguration()
    configuration.Host = "<YOUR_BASE_URL>"
    
    infobipClient := api.NewAPIClient(configuration)
    
    auth := context.WithValue(
		context.Background(),
		infobip.ContextAPIKeys,
		map[string]infobip.APIKey{
			"APIKeyHeader": {Key: "<YOUR_API_KEY>", Prefix: "<YOUR_API_PREFIX>"},
		},
	)
````

For details, check the [client](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-api-go-client/blob/master/v3/pkg/infobip/client.go) source code.

Before sending an email message, you need to verify the domain with which you will be sending emails.

## Send an Email with a file

Fields `from`, `to`, and `subject` are required. The message must also contain at least one of these: `text`, `html`, or `templateId`.

---
**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Keep in mind the following restrictions while using a trial account:

- you can only send messages to verified email addresses,
- you can only use your email address with the Infobip test domain in the following form: `YourUserName@selfserviceib.com`

---

```go
    apiResponse, httpResponse, err := infobipClient.
        EmailAPI.
        SendEmail(auth).
        To([]string{"john.smith@somedomain.com"}).
        From("Jane Smith <jane.smith@somecompany.com>").
        Subject("Mail subject text").
        Text("Test message with a file")).
        Attachment([]*os.File{attachmentFile}).
        Execute()
```

## Delivery reports

For each message that you send out, we can send you a delivery report in real time.
All you need to do is specify your endpoint when sending email in the `notifyUrl` field.

Additionally, you can use a `messageId` or a `bulkId` autogenerated in a response for troubleshooting and to fetch reports.

```go
    bulkId := "BULK-ID-123-xyz";
    numberOfReportsLimit := int32(10);

    response, _, err := infobipClient.
        EmailAPI.
        GetEmailDeliveryReports(auth).
        BulkId(bulkId).
        Limit(numberOfReportsLimit).
        Execute()
```
